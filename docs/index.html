    <h3>OpenEyes: Open Source EPR for Ophthalmology</h3>
    <p>OpenEyes is an electronic patient record application for ophthalmology, developed with contributions from a range of hospitals, institutions, academic departments, companies and individuals. Intuitive to use and fast, it runs in a web browser to ensure that it can be accessed from just about any device in any location. OpenEyes will always be available free-of-charge under an open source license, making it a cost-effective option for eye care, and, perhaps more importantly, ensuring that its development will always prioritise what clincians really need.</p>
    <p>While OpenEyes can be downloaded and used free of charge anywhere in the world, we recommend that installations in a clinical environment are handled through our authorised professional services network. One of our professional services partners <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.suppliers.tkl.email }}?subject=OpenEyes">{{ site.data.suppliers.tkl.name }}</a>, can provide advice and pricing on accredited implementation and support services.</p>
    <p>Our partners will ensure that your clinical data integrates with hospital workflows and PAS system and that the connections to devices such as OCT machines or visual field devices are robust.</p>
